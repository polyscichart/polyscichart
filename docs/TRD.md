# Technical Response Document (TRD) for PolySciChart

## Overview
PolySciChart is a service that delivers graphical charts (e.g., line graphs, bar charts, Pareto charts, pie charts,)
showcase **socio-economic data with political context**—including financial markets, government spending,
national GDP, demographic data, industry inputs, national assets, and debt—based on a unique chart ID. The charts
will include labels, legends, and reference links, optimized for rendering in X posts, with revenue generated
primarily through an X account where charts are published.

PolySciChart post is a pre-generated PNG chart and various contextual text and hash tags posted to X via API.

PolySciChart will generate 1-10 posts a day; with 1/day to start.

The polyscichart.com domain will redirect to the x.com/polyscichart account.

## Key Decisions and Rationale

### 1. Chart Post Definition
- **Decision:** A "PSCPost" (PolySciChart Post) is a pre-generated X post with a PNG chart 
  and context (text, links) in X attributes, tied to a "chart post ID."
- **Rationale:**
    - **Simplicity:** Pre-generating chart posts as X entities keeps the service minimal.
    - **X-Driven:** Users engage via X, aligning with monetization through X traffic.
    - **Low Volume:** At 1-10 posts/day, pre-generation is efficient and consistent.

### 2. Chart Graphic Handling
- **Decision:** PNGs are pre-generated by a local tool (chartgen), posted to X with minimal text;
  PNGs are not stored after posting, retaining source data and X URLs.
- **Rationale:**
    - **Performance:** Pre-generated PNGs deliver instantly via X, avoiding on-the-fly delays.
    - **Fidelity:** PNG ensures high-quality visuals with minimal text for chart focus.
    - **Storage:** X hosts PNGs durably over time; source data allows regeneration if needed,
      minimizing costs vs. retaining PNGs.

### 4. X Integration
- **Decision:** Chart posts render via X; Go-Twitter posts PNGs/context once, stores URLs
  for redirects.
- **Rationale:**
    - **Monetization:** X posts drive sponsor visibility and traffic at low cost.
    - **Efficiency:** One-time posting reuses URLs, fitting 1-10 posts/day easily.
    - **Delivery:** X’s mobile rendering meets usability; users access via X URLs.

### 5. Performance
- **Decision:** All data is submitted via an X post and all user services are via X services.
- **Rationale:**
    - **Primary Traffic:** Users-X interaction via X platform.
- **Secondary Access:** polyscichart.com redirects to X.
    - **Low Volume:** as primary users are via X. redirect is low volume.

### 6. Usability and Mobile Optimization
- **Decision:** Use X’s mobile display for charts, PNGs and minimal text.
- **Rationale:**
    - **Mobile Fit:** X scales PNGs optimized for portrait viewing.
    - **Text:** X post attributes provide context, keeping charts visually clean.

### 7. Security and Reliability
- **Decision:** Content is hosted on X and uses X platform security.
- **Rationale:**
    - **Security:** X handle HTTPS.
    - **Reliability:** X ensure uptime with low risk at small scale.

## Trade-Offs
- **X Dependency:** Users rely on X; downtime or post loss could disrupt access.
- **No PNG Retention:** X hosts PNGs durably, but regeneration is needed if posts are lost.
- **Static Content:** Pre-generation limits updates, suitable for 1-10 posts/day.
